# Brudnogit
This repository serves me as a learning platform. I test new solutions here and gain expierience with stuff. Feel free to wander around, don't expect anything useful though.
# Current stuff I'm playing with
* Vagrantfile - Managed to set up a simple trusty64 Vagrant box, has Apache and PHP for now.
* djtest - Currently dormant attempt to get familiar with the Django Project framework. 
* symtest - The main thing I'm trying to get along with for now.

# Things to keep in mind
* When using a development server in any framework with vagrant, set the address to 0.0.0.0:"your port" so that it can be forwarded!
